# How to contribute

## Setup your development environment

- bash must be installed and available in your PATH (for commitlint).
- to install the dependencies, run `npm install`.
- The dev server will start when you run `npm start`.
- You can debug your features by modifying the `test/test_project/index.ts` file.

## Code style

- Follow the eslint settings. If you ignore eslint, there must be a valid reason.
- Even if the code is less readable, performance is a priority in most cases
- When writing new component, it muse be ensured that the component functions properly for all component lifecycle messages.
- Please follow the commitlint
- If there is any ambiguity, refer to the code that is already written.

## Testing

Writing a test is not mandatory, but if it is not a special case, please write a test.
