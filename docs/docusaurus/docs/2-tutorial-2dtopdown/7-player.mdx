# Player

We'll going to make a player gameObject that will be able to move around the map. and We'll animate the player.

## Create Player Prefab

You can create players with only engine-embedded components without any scripting.

```typescript title="src/asset/prefab/PlayerPrefab.ts"
import {
    CssSpriteAtlasRenderer,
    GameObjectBuilder,
    MovementAnimationController,
    PlayerGridMovementController,
    Prefab,
    SpriteAtlasAnimator
} from "the-world-engine";

import CharSpriteSheet from "../image/Char_Sprites/char_spritesheet.png";

export class PlayerPrefab extends Prefab {

    public override make(): GameObjectBuilder {
        return this.gameObjectBuilder
            .withComponent(CssSpriteAtlasRenderer, c => {
                c.asyncSetImageFromPath(CharSpriteSheet, 26, 23);
                c.imageWidth = 1;
                c.imageHeight = 1;
                c.viewScale = 1;
                c.filter.brightness = 1.2;
            })
            .withComponent(SpriteAtlasAnimator, c => {
                c.addAnimation("down_walk", [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]);
                c.addAnimation("left_walk", [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58]);
                c.addAnimation("right_walk", [79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84]);
                c.addAnimation("up_walk", [105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110]);

                c.addAnimation("down_idle", [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]);
                c.addAnimation("left_idle", [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65]);
                c.addAnimation("right_idle", [86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91]);
                c.addAnimation("up_idle", [112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117]);

                c.frameDuration = 0.1;
                c.playAnimation("down_idle");
            })
            .withComponent(PlayerGridMovementController, c => {
                c.speed = 4;
            })
            .withComponent(MovementAnimationController)
        ;
    }
}
```

- `CssSpriteAtlasRenderer` is a component that renders a sprite atlas image.
- `SpriteAtlasAnimator` is a component that animates the sprite atlas image.
- `PlayerGridMovementController` is a component that moves the player on the grid.
- `MovementAnimationController` is a component that controls the animation of the player. This is a very simple [FSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine).

That's all you need to do and use it on the bootstrapper.

If you don't like the specifications, you can implement these components yourself.

## Build Player Prefab

```typescript title="src/asset/Bootstrapper.ts"
return this.sceneBuilder
    .withChild(instantiater.buildGameObject("tilemap")
        //...    
    )

    .withChild(instantiater.buildPrefab("player", PlayerPrefab)
        .make())

    .withChild(instantiater.buildGameObject("camera")
```

<DocumentGame bootstrapper={Bootstrapper} allowScroll />

Move the player to w, a, s, d.

## Camera Follow Player

We will use the `TrackCameraController`, an internal component of the Engine, to allow the camera to follow the player.

```typescript title="src/asset/Bootstrapper.ts"
const player = new PrefabRef<GameObject>();

return this.sceneBuilder
    .withChild(instantiater.buildGameObject("tilemap")
        //...    
    )

    .withChild(instantiater.buildPrefab("player", PlayerPrefab)
        .make()
        .getGameObject(player))

    .withChild(instantiater.buildGameObject("camera")
        //...
        .withComponent(TrackCameraController, c => {
            c.setTrackTarget(player.ref!);
        }))
;
```

<DocumentGame bootstrapper={Bootstrapper2} allowScroll />

now camera follow player.

```typescript
const player = new PrefabRef<GameObject>();
```

`PrefabRef` is used to inject dependencies when building a scene.
In this case, we want to inject the player GameObject into the `TrackCameraController` component.

```typescript
.getGameObject(player)
```

so we get the player GameObject to the `PrefabRef` object.

```typescript
c.setTrackTarget(player.ref!);
```

Finally, we set the player GameObject to the `TrackCameraController` component.

## Disable Editor Grid Renderer

I think we can disable the grid renderer now that we have some frames.

```typescript title="src/asset/Bootstrapper.ts"
.withComponent(EditorGridRenderer, c => {
    c.enabled = false;
    c.renderWidth = 50;
    c.renderHeight = 50;
})
```

You can enable it whenever you need it for debugging.
