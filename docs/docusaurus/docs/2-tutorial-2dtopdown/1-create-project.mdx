# Create Project

In this tutorial, **you will learn how to use the engine** by organizing your own game.

We will use the features within the engine as much as possible to construct the scene of the **2d topdown game** with minimal code.

## Overview

The game we're going to make looks like this. 
it used **tile maps**, **collision maps**, **event maps**, **animated sprites**, **player grid movements**, **pathfinder**,
and we'll soon find out how to use all of these elements.
