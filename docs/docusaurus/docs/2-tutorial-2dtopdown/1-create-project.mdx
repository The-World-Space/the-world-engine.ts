# Create Project

In this tutorial, **you will learn how to use the engine** by organizing your own game.

We will use the features within the engine as much as possible to construct the scene of the **2d topdown game** with minimal code.

## Overview

The game we're going to make looks like this. 
it used **tile maps**, **collision maps**, **event maps**, **animated sprites**, **player grid movements**, **pathfinder**,
and we'll soon find out how to use all of these elements.

<DocumentGame bootstrapper={Bootstrapper} allowScroll />

## Create Project

First, follow the Installation Guide in **[Getting Started/Installation](../getting-started/installation)** to create a project.

And make a bootstrapper skeleton.

```typescript title="src/index.ts"
import { Game } from "the-world-engine";

import { Bootstrapper } from "./asset/Bootstrapper";

const game = new Game(document.body);
game.run(Bootstrapper);
game.inputHandler.startHandleEvents();
```

```typescript title="src/asset/Bootstrapper.ts"
import {
    Bootstrapper as BaseBootstrapper,
    Camera,
    SceneBuilder
} from "the-world-engine";

export class Bootstrapper extends BaseBootstrapper {
    public override run(): SceneBuilder {
        const instantiater = this.instantiater;

        return this.sceneBuilder
            .withChild(instantiater.buildGameObject("camera")
                .withComponent(Camera))
        ;
    }
}
```

Now you're ready to make a scene. Most of our journeys will take place at Bootstrapper.ts.

Then let's get started!
