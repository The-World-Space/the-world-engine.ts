# Create Component

Let's create our `Component` and add them to the `GameObject`

:::tip tip
Component corresponds to Unity's [MonoBehaviour](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html) class.
:::

## Rotator Component

Let's make a component that rotates objects at a constant speed

```typescript title="./src/asset/script/Rotator.ts"
import { Component } from "the-world-engine";

export class Rotator extends Component {
    private readonly _rotationSpeed: number = 1;
    
    public update(): void { // update is called once per frame
        this.gameObject.transform.rotateZ(
            this._rotationSpeed * this.engine.time.deltaTime);
    }
}
```

then we can add it to our `GameObject`

```typescript title="./src/asset/Bootstrapper.ts"
//...
.withChild(instantiater.buildGameObject("sprite1", new Vector3(0, 0, 0))
    .withComponent(CssSpriteRenderer, c => {
        c.asyncSetImageFromPath("https://c.tenor.com/jJalYO9p0PAAAAAd/hatsune-miku-plush.gif");
        c.imageWidth = 6;
        c.imageHeight = 6;
    })
    .withComponent(Rotator))
//...
```

## Component Messages

the component messages are called when the gameObject meets certain conditions.

The list below is a list of the available messages.

### Basic Messages

These are the most commonly used messages.

- `awake`: awake is called when the script instance is being loaded.
- `start`: start is called on the frame when a script is enabled just before any of the update methods are called the first time.
- `update`: update is called every frame, if the Component is enabled.
- `onDestroy`: Destroying the attached Component will result in the game or Scene receiving onDestroy.
- `onEnable`: This function is called when the object becomes enabled and active.
- `onDisable`: This function is called when the behaviour becomes disabled.

### Physics Messages

These are the messages related to game engine built-in physics engine(box2d).

- `onCollisionEnter2D`: Sent when an incoming collider makes contact with this object's collider (2D physics only).
- `onCollisionExit2D`: Sent when a collider on another object stops touching this object's collider (2D physics only).
- `onCollisionStay2D`: Sent each frame where a collider on another object is touching this object's collider (2D physics only).
- `onTriggerEnter2D`: Sent when another object enters a trigger collider attached to this object (2D physics only).
- `onTriggerExit2D`: Sent when another object leaves a trigger collider attached to this object (2D physics only).
- `onTriggerStay2D`: Sent each frame where another object is within a trigger collider attached to this object (2D physics only).

### Unsafe Messages

If you add or remove GameObjects or Components within this messages, proper behavior is not guaranteed (performance reasons).

- `onWorldMatrixUpdated`: This function is called when the world matrix is updated.
