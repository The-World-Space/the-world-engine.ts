# Prefab

If you keep writing scenes on the bootstrapper, the bootstrapper will become too big.

**You can use prefab to separate scene builds**. It's like separating components in React development.

## Make a prefab

We going to make a camera prefab that tracks a specific object.

```typescript title="./src/asset/prefab/CameraPrefab.ts"
import { 
    Camera,
    GameObject,
    GameObjectBuilder,
    Prefab,
    PrefabRef,
    TrackCameraController
} from "the-world-engine";

export class CameraPrefab extends Prefab {
    private _trackObject = new PrefabRef<GameObject>();
    private _camera = new PrefabRef<Camera>();

    //If you add a value inside the prefab from the outside, you can create the with method
    public withTrackObject(trackObject: PrefabRef<GameObject>): this {
        this._trackObject = trackObject;
        return this;
    }

    //When receiving the value inside the prefab from the outside, it is possible by creating the get method
    public getCamera(componentRef: PrefabRef<Camera>): this {
        this._camera = componentRef;
        return this;
    }

    public override make(): GameObjectBuilder {
        return this.gameObjectBuilder
            .withComponent(Camera)
            .withComponent(TrackCameraController, c => {
                c.lerpTrack = true;
                if (this._trackObject.ref) c.setTrackTarget(this._trackObject.ref);
            })
            .getComponent(Camera, this._camera)
        ;
    }
}
```
:::tip
It is recommended that the method of exporting something from a prefab starts with the name "with"
And it is recommended that the method of getting something from the prefab starts with the name "get".
:::
:::tip
You can see that the implementation of the "get" method and the "with" method is the same, because it works as a call by reference.

Eventually, the behavior is determined by whether the reference is read or written inside the prefab.

For this code, `this._camera` will be exposed as "get" method because the value was writed at `.getComponent(Camera, this._camera)`

And `this._trackObject` will be exposed as "with" method because the value was readed at `if (this._trackObject.ref) c.setTrackTarget(this._trackObject.ref);`

## Add a prefab to the builder

Now we can create camera from CameraPrefab.

```typescript title="./src/asset/Bootstrapper.ts"
import { /*...*/ } from "the-world-engine";
import { CameraPrefab } from "./prefab/CameraPrefab";

export class Bootstrapper extends BaseBootstrapper {
    public run(): SceneBuilder {
        const instantiater = this.instantiater;

        const trackObject = new PrefabRef<GameObject>();
        const camera = new PrefabRef<Camera>();

        return this.sceneBuilder
            .withChild(instantiater.buildPrefab("camera", CameraPrefab) // build prefab!
                .withTrackObject(trackObject)
                .getCamera(camera)
                .make())

            .withChild(instantiater.buildGameObject("player")
                .withComponent(CssSpriteRenderer)
                .withComponent(PlayerGridMovementController)
                .getGameObject(trackObject))
        ;
    }
}
```
